            <p class="cyberpara"> Cyberbullying is the use of digital technology, such as social media or messaging
                apps, to harass,
                intimidate, or harm individuals by sending hurtful messages, sharing offensive content, or engaging in
                other forms of online aggression. It often occurs anonymously, making it challenging to identify the
                perpetrators, and can have severe emotional consequences on the targeted individuals.</p>

            <h1>Effects</h1>
            <h3>Emotional Distress:
            </h3>
            <p>Victims of cyberbullying often experience heightened levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.
                The continuous nature of online harassment can lead to a constant state of fear and emotional turmoil.
            </p>

            <h3>Low Self-Esteem:</h3>
            <p>Constant negative feedback and humiliation can contribute to low self-esteem and feelings of
                worthlessness.
                Cyberbullying attacks can damage an individual's confidence and self-image.
            </p>

            <h3>Isolation:
            </h3>
            <p>Victims may withdraw from social interactions, both online and offline, to avoid further harassment.
                This isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness and exacerbate mental health issues.</p>

            <h3>Academic Impact:</h3>
            <p>Cyberbullying can interfere with a victim's ability to focus on academics, leading to a decline in grades
                and overall academic performance.
            </p>

            <h3>Physical Health Issues:</h3>
            <p>Prolonged exposure to cyberbullying stressors can manifest physically, leading to headaches, sleep
                disturbances, and other stress-related health issues.</p>


            <h3>Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors:</h3>
            <p>
                In extreme cases, cyberbullying has been linked to an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
            </p>

        <div class="prev">
            <h1>Preventions</h1>
            <h3>Promote Digital Literacy:
            </h3>
            <p>Educate individuals, especially children and teenagers, about responsible online behavior, digital
                citizenship, and the potential consequences of cyberbullying.
            </p>

            <h3>Encourage Open Communication:</h3>
            <p>Foster an environment where individuals feel comfortable discussing their online experiences, including
                instances of cyberbullying. Encourage open communication with parents, teachers, and peers.
            </p>

            <h3>Establish Internet Etiquette
            </h3>
            <p>Teach and promote respectful online behavior, emphasizing the importance of treating others as you would
                like to be treated. Establish clear guidelines for appropriate online conduct.</p>

            <h3>Monitor Online Activity:</h3>
            <p>Parents and guardians should actively monitor their children's online activities, including social media
                interactions and messages. Be aware of the platforms they use and the people they connect with online.
            </p>

            <h3>Set Boundaries and Screen Time Limits:</h3>
            <p>Establish clear guidelines for screen time and internet use. Setting reasonable limits on the amount of
                time spent online can reduce the likelihood of encountering cyberbullying situations.</p>
